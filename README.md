# AutoDoorPlus
Making your life easier and more secure with automated door systems.

## Inspiration:
I was inspired to undertake this project by losing my keys all the time. In apartment I currently live in, my front door is still locked by a physical key that I have to carry with me at all times. In my parent's house, my door is controlled by a pin code lock we installed, but because I just rent my current apartment, I'm unable to modify the door with an automatic lock. I wanted to create a non-invasive device that could pull down my door handle remotely so I could access my living space with just my phone. 

## What It Does:
With AutoDoor+, whether you rent or own your apartment, you too can remotely open your doors without the burden of carrying a physical key around. Using a rack and pinion assembly, AutoDoor+ can be adjusted to fit most conventional door handles. It also has different strength options for the different force amounts required to pull the handle down.

## Keyless Entry: 
AutoDoor eliminates the need for physical keys by allowing users to unlock doors using their smartphones or other authorized devices. This provides a more secure and convenient way to access homes, offices, or any other space.

## Remote Access: 
Users can remotely control and monitor their doors from anywhere using a mobile app or a web interface. This feature enables users to grant access to visitors or service providers even when they are not physically present.

## Access Control:
AutoDoor allows users to set up access permissions for different individuals or groups. This ensures that only authorized personnel can enter specific areas, providing an added layer of security.

## Activity Logs: The system keeps track of door activities, including who accessed the door and at what time. This log can be useful for security purposes or for monitoring employee attendance.

## Integration with Smart Home Systems: 
AutoDoor can be integrated with existing smart home systems, allowing users to control their doors along with other connected devices such as lights, thermostats, or window blinds.
